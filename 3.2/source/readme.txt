About building from source
--------------------------

To build from the source you need to download GCBasic from:
http://gcbasic.sourceforge.net/

Make sure you also dowload (and install) the latest update.zip:
http://gcbasic.sourceforge.net/newfiles/update.zip

To get started, read this guide and install and configure Crimson Editor:
http://gcbasic.sourceforge.net/starting.html

That should be enough to get you started.

You also need to copy the contents of d2a_patch.asm, d2b_patch.asm or large_patch.asm
and paste it just before "END" in compiled.asm that is located in your GCBASIC folder. The run
MAKEASM.BAT to recreate compiled.hex.
